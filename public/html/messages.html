<h2>Chairperson's Message</h2>
<img  src="static/Chairperson.png" >
<p>It gives me immense pleasure to know this hallowed institution is raising the bar yet again with
the announcement of the <strong>‘Shri M M Kothari STEAM Quest, Ingenious - 2022’</strong>, an Inter-School
Technical, Linguistic, Cultural and Academic Festival that celebrates – Science, Technology,
Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics – enough to power the engine of all its participants
with the requisite energy and gusto. STEAM also empowers our ‘ingenious’ and prospective
unicorns to see the light of the day with advertising its special E-Commerce forum, an initiative
that will ignite fiery thought-processes that will spur the economic charts of the country.
<br>
<br>
And to know that it is happening in July, that special month of the year when we celebrate
Founder’s Day, in memory of Shri M.M. Kothari, our Beloved Babuji, Honourable Founder of this
esteemed institution, that one towering personality who stood head and shoulders above the
rest in terms of a vision that he dreamt of, a vision that continues to fuel each inmate of the KIS
fraternity, a vision that has stood the test of time in terms of an all-round growth of its young
citizens, ensuring that no latent talent goes unnoticed, no budding desire gets extinguished, no
willing mind and spirit is discouraged, then one can only sit back in humility and gratitude at our
Founder’s vision.
<br>
<br>
<strong>‘Shri M M Kothari STEAM Quest, Ingenious - 2022’</strong>, intends to provide a robust platform for a myriad range of infinite talent. Three cheers for that!
<br>
<br>
<strong>“There is a force more powerful than steam and electricity: the will.”</strong>
<br>
<br>
On this note, my BEST WISHES and BLESSINGS to TEAM KIS!!
<br>
Warm regards
<br>
Arti Kothari

<br>
It is a matter of great delight and immense satisfaction to note that Kothari International
School has embarked upon this exciting journey of Inter-School Competitiveness by firing one
of the first salvos this Academic Session, the <strong>'Shri M M Kothari STEAM Quest, Ingenious -
2022'</strong>, that will test the Inter-Disciplinary Excellence and preparedness of its fellow competitors
in the Field of Education and Learning. What this Festival-de-Coup - STEAM strives to do is to
ignite the <b>S</b>cientific and <b>T</b>echnological temper of young India as also fan their<b> E</b>ngineering,
<b>A</b>rtistic and <b>M</b>athematical skills to the core.
<br>
<br>
Surely success will be ours when we aim to provide equal and effective opportunities of active
collaboration, aspire for an all-round holistic development of the children, sharpen their
critical, logical and analytical thinking, polish their managerial acumen and drill into them a
business sense of mind. Over and above all of this, ingrain in them a sense of healthy
competition that doesn’t disintegrate into winning at all costs.
<br>
<br>
Also what stands out like an oasis in this desert of cut-throat rivalries is the fact the Students of
the Host School will not be descending upon this heated arena like warring warriors but as
peaceful participants who will taste the flavour of the dish but never to satiate their yearning
to score a bull’s eye. When the <strong>'Shri M M Kothari STEAM Quest, Ingenious - 2022'</strong> , intends
to provide a never-before experience to all, then to Team KIS I say, stride confidently and
march on.
<br>
<br>
God Bless!! Congratulations KIS and we have only just begun to warm up!!
<br>
Warm regards

<p>In the 21st century, empowering our Students to give way to a transformative and revolutionary
future must be the paramount vision of the educational realm. Dwelling in today’s world, we do
not know what or how the future jobs will be; however, it is a pivotal need to educate students
with the skills and the capacity to think out of the box with creative and successful solutions to
surmount the unprecedented times. This is the goal that <strong>STEAM</strong> Education can effectively
prepare our Students for.<br><br>
The system of standardised learning has been prevailing in the Indian Education System for
many years. This system does not focus extensively on teaching Students how to solve real
world problems and is not interdisciplinary and collaborative in nature. On the contrary,<strong> STEAM</strong>
is an Educational Discipline that kindles interest, ignites the embers and results in a lifelong
love of the Arts and the Sciences in Students from the foundational years. The amalgamation
of Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics involve the creative processes
that use inquiry and investigation. Teaching cutting-edge skills will undeniably prepare students
to become innovators in an ever-evolving world, not only for the future of the students
themselves but for the future of the world.<br><br>
<strong>STEAM</strong> empowers teachers to employ the experiential learning that entails each of the five
disciplines and fosters an inclusive learning environment in which all students are able to
engage and contribute effectively.<br><br>
Therefore, we must promote an integrated trans-disciplinary approach of teaching and
learning and to emphasise the same, the school is initiating its first STEAM Inter School Event -
<strong>‘Shri M M Kothari STEAM Quest, Ingenious - 2022.’</strong><br><br><strong>
“Integration is a basic law of life; when we resist it, disintegration is the natural result,
both inside and outside of us. Thus, we come to the concept of harmony through
integration.”</strong><br> - Norman Cousins<br><br>

<p>With the ever-changing world and society, evolution in the field of Education is also paramount.
The <strong>STEAM</strong> Education not only allows teachers to apply the new methods of teaching through
Project Based Learning but also engages and promotes students to think out of the box and
imbibe these interdisciplinary learning experiences. <strong>STEAM</strong> Education helps in developing
practical skills. Students develop the capacity to take risks, become resilient problem solvers,
innovate, collaborate and seek creative solutions to real life problems.<br><br>
<strong>‘Shri M M Kothari STEAM Quest, Ingenious - 2022’</strong> is a Student-led Three - Day Mega Event
which will not only host an array of Events based on Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts
and Mathematics but also tap several spaces for Students to rediscover themselves. It will
challenge the technical prowess of the Students and evoke innovation thus reflecting and
defining a revolutionary path breaking process in the Educational System.<br><br>
Kothari International School has always supported and encouraged a new vision and a
perspective, especially when it originates from our Students. We are more than eager to
implement their vision and help them shape this event to reach unsurpassed heights.
“Finally, never stop learning as it can be tough to thrive in a fast-paced industry. By keeping
your skills sharp, not only will you strengthen your confidence, but your credibility with others
too.”<br><br><strong>
"Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did
something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw
something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s because they were able to
connect experiences they’ve had and synthesise new things." </strong><br>- Steve Jobs<br><br>
