DURATION: 3 Hours (10am - 1pm)

1) Participants will be given the task of making a Robot (ground based, no aerial aspect allowed). 
    The Robot will have to navigate a track. The objective is for the Robot to complete the track 
    in the least amount of time with the least number of mistakes

2) The Robot would not be controlled by the participants while on track. It must
     have capabilities of an autonomous control to navigate the track without
     continuous human inputs

3) The Robot has to be made by the participants of the team themselves before
     arriving for the Competition. Use of any kind of robotic kits or ready-to-make 
     sets is prohibited and will lead to disqualification of the Team

4) The use of Microcontrollers (for example Arduino) is allowed for autonomous
     control of the Robot. But other High End Boards (like RaspberryPi) and IOT
     based Circuit Boards (like NodeMCU) are not allowed

5) A DC power supply needs to be used for powering the robot and it should be
     an integral part of the robot.

6) The chassis of the Robot can be 3D printed, made out of wood, or made out of
     metal but direct use of a fully developed chassis with motors and circuitry for
     making the Robot is prohibited. The basic circuitry of the Robot including
     breadboard/ PCB, motors, sensors, wheel are permitted

7) The Participants have to get their own laptop and hardware for making any
     changes to the program and fine tuning the robot at the venue before the
     competition begins
